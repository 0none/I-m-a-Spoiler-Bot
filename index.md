> A friendly Telegram bot to hide spoilers sent.

## About
Me and my friends were used to use a bot to send spoilers in the main group of anime discussions, but this bot doesn't works anymore. That's why I've decided to write my own version of this bot so we can continue to send each other messages without disturbing the others group members that haven't read manga chapter or watched the anime episode yet.

**note**: all of the spoilers are just stored for one week period!

### Disclaimer
By default all the commands are in English, but you can see if the same command is available in your language.

# How to use it
First of all, talk to [@ispoilerbot](http://t.me/ispoilerbot).

**note**: urls are automatically shortened.

## Sending Spoilers
Basically there are two kinds of spoiler, those of _light_ weight, that won't ask the user to confirm to see it, and those of **heavy** weight, that will will ask permission to be displayed.

The inline mode works in any chat conversation:

```
@ispoilerbot spoiler to be sent here as text
```

Example:

```
@ispoilerbot L dies!
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="./others/gif/help.1.gif"/>
</div>

And you can also send a spoiler name it about what it is:

```
@ispoilerbot spoiler to be sent here as text "spoiler name"
```

Example:

```
@ispoilerbot L dies! "Death Note"
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="./others/gif/help.2.gif"/>
</div>

The heavy spoilers with:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./others/gif/help.3.gif"/>
</div>

And those lewd spoilers with -- I've added this option in a kind of future proofing if Apple changes it's [policies](https://www.businessinsider.com/apples-porn-policy-2013-1) again.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./others/gif/help.4.gif"/>
</div>

## Help
If you have any other questions about it just use it the help command:

```
/help
```
